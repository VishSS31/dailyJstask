Task1 Overview
1. Data Types Introduction
2. Mathematical Operators
3. Comparator Operators
Instructions
1. Data Types Introduction
○ Declare variables of different data types: string, number, boolean,
undefined, and null.
○ Print each variable and its type using console.log and the typeof
operator.
2. Mathematical Operators
○ Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) with two number
variables.
○ Print the results of each operation.
3. Comparator Operators
○ Use comparator operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) to compare
two variables of the same and different data types.
○ Print the results of each comparison

Task2 Overview
● If-Else Conditional Statements
● Switch-Case Statements
● Ternary Operator
● For Loop
Instructions
1. If-Else Conditional Statements
○ Write a program that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
○ Print the appropriate message for each case using if-else statements.
2. Switch-Case Statements
○ Create a program that takes a day of the week as an input (1 for Monday,
2 for Tuesday, etc.).
○ Use a switch-case statement to print the name of the day.
3. Ternary Operator
○ Declare a variable age and assign it a value.
○ Use a ternary operator to check if the age is 18 or more and print "Adult" if
true, otherwise print "Minor".
4. For Loop
○ Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
5. Reverse For Loop
○ Write a program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order
using a for loop
